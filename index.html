      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a freshman at UCSD. I am undeclared but I intend to be a Computer Science major, or maybe a Cognitive Science major. We'll see how things pan out. Either way I'm excited to learn at the bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Diego, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like playing video games and vibing to my music with some friends. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be honest I want to be a Twitch streamer. But realistically I want to be a software engineer. I actually haven't put too much thought into it, I see Computer Science as a direction in life. I haven't really seen what it has in store for me yet.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I still live in San Diego, I'm a full-time student at UCSD, so all my time for the next couple of years will be in my lovely city.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I wouldn't exactly say that I want to be a web developer. I want the experience and knowledge in order to branch out so I can discover what I really want to do with computer programming.</p>
